I am so glad that you would come to my blog, first of all, I am not a big bull.

As a student of mathematics, we must become familiar with all the signs and symbols commonly used in mathematics and bear them in mind and be well versed in the definitions, and formulas as well as the technical terms in the field of mathematics, in order that he may be able to build up the foundation of the mathematical subject and master it well for pursuing advanced study.

Life should not only coding, I am a sunshine boy ~. In spare time, I like reading book, surfing internet, watching movie and taking a leisurely walk outdoors. If we have the same interestings, we can have a chat and play together.

On this site, you can know some my personal life, some strange ideas as well as some tips. Life is colorful, this website was, is and will be the window which used to present the color of my life.
